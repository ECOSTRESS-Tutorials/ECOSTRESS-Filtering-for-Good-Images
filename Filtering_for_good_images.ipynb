    "# Filtering for Good Images\n",
    "### ECOSTRESS Tutorials\n",
    "###### This code is best suited for use when you have a folder of files that you would like to be automatically filtered to get just the good images. In this case, the good images are ones that have been georeferenced, have minimal cloud cover, and have mostly good quality (not null) pixels. In addition to the files you want to filter, the input directory should also have the images' associated QC files and a statistics CSV. This can all be downloaded from the AppEEARS website. "
